# PaleoBioGeoBEARS
This is a project for use in the PhyloMEth course on phylogenetic methods being taught by Brian O'Meara at the University of Tennessee.

It will be used to create an interface with BioGeoBEARS by Nick Matzke (http://phylo.wikidot.com/biogeobears) with GPlates (http://www.gplates.org/) via rPython and pygplates. I will also explore ways to utilize the Paleobiology Database (PBDB) using r package "paleobiodDB" in conjuction with these other methods.
