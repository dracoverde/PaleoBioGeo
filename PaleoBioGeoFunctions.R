  ### (time is the issue here - I only need paleocoordinates for the species samples present in a basin during the times it is present. I have to consier FAD and LAD and one-offs. Also, do I marke a species present during the time of the layer it is found or the time of the full formation.)


# map phylogeny through time?

# how might I use spreading rates?

# include functions "strap", "geoscale", or other such fossil and paleo packages? (including "paleoDB)
